<br><br>
Delhi's most famous monument, the Red Fort stands as a powerful reminder of the Mughal emperors who ruled India. The fort is more than 350 years old. It has withstood the turbulent trials and tribulations of time‚Äîand attack‚Äîto be the setting of some of India's most important historical events that shaped the country. The fort's Old Delhi location, opposite Chandni Chowk, is fascinating as well. A sound and light show is held there in the evenings. Recent restoration of the shopfronts in the fort's Meena Bazaar and the addition of a new museum complex dedicated to India's freedom fighters has drawn more local Indian visitors, thus increasing footfall at the fort.
<br><br>
Location: Old Delhi.

<b><h2>3. Qutub Minar</h2></b>
<br><br>

<img src='https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/YJeYzy0Brx0nW9aNpALnWqOP2YA=/537x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/OLDDELHI2019-1-86-e16ea9bb759446069f82847c06ba7454.JPG' height='300' width='500' style='border:5px dashed orangered;'>

<br><br>
One of Delhi's top attractions, Qutab Minar is the tallest brick minaret in the world and is an incredible example of early Indo‚ÄìIslamic architecture. It's widely believed that it dates back to the 13th century, when Qutab-Ud-Din-Aibak (founder of the Delhi Sultanate) is said to have started constructing it. However, a great deal of controversy surrounds its origin and purpose. It may in fact have originally been a Hindu tower. The tower has five distinct stories and a height of 72.5 meters (238 feet). Several other historic monuments are on the site as well. Unfortunately, there's been a steady decline in footfall over the last three years.
<br><br>
Location: Mehrauli, South Delhi.

<b><h2>4. Konark Sun Temple</h2></b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
The magnificent Sun Temple in Konark is regarded as the grandest and most well known of India's sun temples. It's believed to have been constructed in the 13th century, towards the end of Odisha's temple building phase, and follows the popular Kalinga school of temple architecture. What sets it apart from other temples in Odisha is its distinctive chariot shape. The temple is dedicated to Surya the Sun God and was designed to be his colossal cosmic chariot, with 12 pairs of wheels pulled by seven horses.
<br><br>
Location: On the coast of Odisha, about 50 minutes east of Puri and 1.5 hours southeast of capital city Bhubaneshwar. Konark is popularly visited as part of the Bhubaneshwar-Konark-Puri triangle.

<br><br>
One of the top forts in India, Golconda Fort is a popular day trip from Hyderabad. It was founded as a mud fort by the Kakatiya Kings of Waranga in the 13th century. However, its heyday was during the reign of the Qutub Shahi dynasty in the 16th century, before they shifted their capital to Hyderabad. Later, during the 17th century, Golconda Fort rose to prominence for its diamond market. Some of the world's most priceless diamonds were found in the area.
<br><br>
Location: On the outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana.

<b><h2>6. The Charminar</h2></b>
<br><br>

<img src='https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/kQ7OrzQJWyrcsn2zR2l7ZuH-wyU=/537x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-164120401-23d3d0420c8e4ec4a0eea8bae5855706.jpg' height='300' width='500' style='border:5px dashed orangered;'>

<br><br>
Hyderabad's most distinctive monument, the Charminar, was completed in 1591. It was made to be the city's centerpiece when Qutub Shahi dynasty ruler Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah shifted his capital to Hyderabad from nearby Golconda Fort. Its architecture was considered to be groundbreaking and is still regarded as a masterpiece. As well as being ceremonial gateway, the Charminar is also a place of worship for Muslims. Go inside to get a spectacular view across the Old City to other historic landmarks such as Mecca Masjid.
<br><br>
Location: In the center of Hyderabad's Old City.

<b><h2>7. Ajanta Caves</h2></b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
The Ajanta Caves are 30 caves which have been carved into a giant cliff face. These marvellous caves are in a fantastic condition due to being ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù until 1819 when a British tiger hunting party stumbled upon them. Imagine their surprise turning into awe as they realised the significance of their discovery! The Ajanta Caves were built in 2 BCE and are decorated with Buddhist religious art that is considered important by historians.  The importance of the art contained within these caves is evidenced by the Archaeological Survey of India which states that the caves contain ‚Äúthe finest surviving examples of Indian art, particularly painting.‚Äù

<b><h2>8. Agra Fort</h2></b>
<br><br>

<br><br>

Located close to the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort is an unmissable red fortress containing many traditional Indian wonders. The impression one gets from a visit to this fort is one of grandeur, with some of the buildings within its confines being constructed with marble. Its long and colourful history includes many instances of armies utilising the fort; something which is still the case today as the Indian Army still uses part of the fort! Visit Agra Fort and be blown away by the fabulous architecture.

<b><h2>9. Group of Monuments at Mamallapuram/Mahabalipuram</h2></b>
<br><br>

<img src='https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/lV5qLcGc3d58ghav_5bGJ2JTszI=/537x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-626905394-4873afdfb1194f9aae61054a2e7a69f4.jpg' height='300' width='500' style='border:5px dashed orangered;'>

<br><br>
A renowned beach getaway from Chennai, Mamallapuram has a UNESCO-listed group of monuments consisting of the Five Rathas (sculptured temples in the shape of chariots) and Arjuna's Penance (a huge carving on the face of a rock depicting scenes from the Hindu epic The Mahabharata). The Mamallapuram Dance Festival is held during late December to late January at Arjuna's Penance. Another attraction is the windswept Shore Temple on the water's edge.
<br><br>
Location: Approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Chennai, on the east coast of India in Tamil Nadu. It's 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of Pondicherry.

<b><h2>10. Fatehpur Sikri</h2></b>
<br><br>

<img src='https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/CwpCGD-Bi-LCcc1IHaMGKAbhYOo=/537x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-645085668-591a8ae93df78cf5fa391ec6.jpg' height='300' width='500' style='border:5px dashed orangered;'>

<br><br>
lthough there are other monuments with a greater footfall than Fatehpur Sikri, it has been included on this list due to its substantial revenue from ticket sales, indicating its relative popularity with foreign tourists. This well-preserved abandoned city was once the proud capital of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. It was deserted after only 15 years, apparently due to insufficient water supply. The most convenient way to visit Fatehpur Sikri is on a day trip from Agra.
<br><br>
Location: About 45 minutes west of Agra.
